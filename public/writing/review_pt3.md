1. Foundations
2. Past, Present and Future
3. **Neural Nets**
4. Data in Practice
5. Machine Learning Art

Notes:
In this presentation we'll go into detail about deep learning and neural nets as well as covering some issues related data collection for training these networks.

In the first tutorial, Foundations, we went over the principles and foundations needed to understand the philosophy and importance of machine learning art. In the second, Past, Present, Future we looked at the historical context and explored the origins of machine learning art, to see how the technology was developed, how it was thought of and shaped by its creators and how it influenced the world. We looked at the current start of the art and imagined some possible futures.

Now we'll go into detail into how neural nets are constructed, trained and operated. We'll also look at the current problems neural nets face. All neural nets require data to train on, and we'll take a look at the ethics of data collection and appropriation.



### Foundations
* Digital: noise, copies and ethics
* Software: abstraction and neural nets
* Intelligence and digital intelligence

Notes:
In Foundations we started with a basic understand of digital technology - a battle against noise to create a strange digital world of perfect, cheap copies that radically changes what is possible to compute. We discussed the ethical implications of this. We got to know some of the basic principles that underlie all software and how neural net software, that excels at pattern recognition, differs from traditional programmed software. Then looked at different ways of thinking about intelligence: narrow versus general, conscious versus nonconscious cogition, and stupidity versus good judgment. Finally, we talked about what happens when intelligence becomes digital and those implications.



### Past, Present, Future
* Exponential technology development
* Past:
  * Pre-20th century developments in mathematics and mechanical automata
  * 20th century: 
    * Information theory, Turning machines, and symbolic AI
    * Digital computers 
    * Cybernetics and early neural nets
    * First AI winter and early computer art
    * Rise of expert systems and symbolic AI
    * Second AI winter and the Canadian conspiracy 
  * 21st century:
    * Deep learning: a massive investment
* Present
  * State-of-the-art deep learning
    * Assistants, translation, generative models
  * Surveillance, whales, and automation
* Future:
  * Neuro-symbolic AI
  * Better, more general learning with less data
  * (Video) generation for one: art vs entertainment
  * Autonomous AI (artist)

Notes:
Exponential phenomenon, which technology development trends tends to follow, are surprising to human thinking. In 2021, papers are released every day that make important contributions to arts and sciences in contrast to just 100 years ago when the timing was on the order of months.

TODO: history

Moving to present day, we looked at the state-of-the-art machine learning including assistant, translation, recommendation, and moderation technologies and how those are used to continue the progression of a monopolistic business environment dependent on surveillance and advertising. We did a quick look at popular generative models used by artists in the last few years.

I ended with some predictions about the future. A possible combining of symbolic and neural net practices and an assured improvement to training to reduce the amount of data needed and better general from that data. Video generation will become possible and make clear that artistic creation is possible for all, becoming less about training and more about direction and curation. This also means AI tools will be able to create content for a single person, potentially manipulating for the gain of whoever controls the AI. Be sure to control the AIs you use yourself! Could these AIs have their own agency or will it always be a reflection of yours?
