# About

<div class="columns">

<div class="small instructions left column">

This is a series of 5 hour-long narrated presentations intended to teach 
the history, current practice and future of using machines and machine learning (A.I.) to create art. Rather than a how-to guide, the focus is on understanding how to think about and interact with digital data and machine tools ethically.

These tutorials are dense! They are designed to be gone through at your own pace, reviewing and taking breaks when you need. 

There are also [PDFs of the tutorials](../text_versions/) available.

Originally created by Ryan Kelln for a project in concert with Jason Baerg, with support from Interaccess, OCADU  and the Canada Council for the Arts, the original audience was a group of Indigenous scholars and artists, but this has been expanded to anyone who wants to have a deeper understanding of machine learning and art â€” without having much background in these areas to start.

This About section is a slideshow too! You can press _right_ or _down_ arrows for more information about this project.

What is this?

These tutorials are technically a web-based slideshow presentation using the Reveal.js framework, but I've tried to make it feel more like watching a video - except that it's a webpage and under your control. There is a play button and timeline at the bottom of screens with video or narration.<!-- .element: class="small tall left" -->

Who is behind this?

<div class="small instructions tall left">

The main contributor thus far is [Ryan Kelln](http://ryankelln.com), but this open source project is built from a variety of technologies and remixes countless sources of research and media to best try to convey the concepts presented.<!-- .element: class="lighten" -->

You can find links to the source content in the top right corner of slides, but more full credits are in the text notes for each slide. You can press _S_ to bring up the notes for any slide.

Notes:

See, here are the notes! Normally these notes would show the text of the narration.

They are actually designed for presenting the slideshow, so it's a bit of a hack. You may want to check out the [PDFs of the talks](../text_versions/) if you want to read though them instead, but you'll miss out on the video content.
