Notes:
In this presentation we'll cover the past, present and future of computing, machine learning and art.

In the previous tutorial, Foundations, we went over the principles and foundations needed to understand the philosophy and importance of machine learning art. Now we'll uncover context and explore origins, to see how the technology was developed, how it was thought of and shaped by its creators and how it influenced the world, particularly the art world.

Notes:
In Foundations we started with a basic understand of digital technology - a battle against noise to create a strange digital world of perfect, cheap copies that radically changes what is possible to compute. After thousands of years of ritualized algorithms digital machines using Boolean algebra allowed Alan Turing to imagine a Universal Computing Machine that could compute anything using only a tape to read, write and compare operations and an internal state. Over time engineers and computer scientists built layers of abstraction as computing machinery grew in speed. Software running on these machines takes input from the user, making it different from other types of recordings. Mappings convert input to output, stateful software, like the Turing machines, have a memory. Adaptive software changes what states are needed to best interact with its environment.

We discussed the ethical implications of digital technologies stemming from the perfect, free copies and the great moral question of when are you responsible for others well-being? 

We discussed the differences between traditional software programming and machine learning practices and ML systems strengths for pattern recognition and prediction.

Then we looked at what does intelligence mean? We are surrounded by narrow intelligences, skilled a few tasks, while research looks to build more general intelligences capable of human-level learning and adaption to new tasks and skills. We found that intelligence doesn't reside just in a brain, and wondered if general intelligence requires consciousness, and what constitutes conscious thought. This lead to examining our model of ourselves and the world, how strange that is, sometimes leading to stupidity and hopefully at other times to good judgment. I claimed freewill is an illusion that is necessary for us to believe so that we can learn.

Finally, we looked at how digital minds inherit the digital weirdness. Like all complicated minds they are difficult to understand, but being digital they can be inspected, frozen in time, and experimented on in ways that aren't possible if they weren't digital. Researchers regularly share the intelligences they have built with the world including all the software details and data sets with which they were constructed. These minds laid bare is one of the reasons creating conscious digital minds is an ethical nightmare, in addition to thee the 200-year-old example of Frankenstein's impossible ethical conundrum when creating a conscious, but wholly alien general intelligence.

Now I think we're ready for some history.
