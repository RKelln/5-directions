I acknowledge the land I live on is the traditional territory of many nations including the Mississaugas of the Credit, the Anishnabeg, the Chippewa, the Haudenosaunee and the Wendat peoples and is now home to many diverse First Nations, Inuit and MÃ©tis. I also acknowledge that Toronto is covered by Treaty 13 signed with the Mississaugas of the Credit, and the Williams Treaty signed with multiple Mississaugas and Chippewa bands.  

I am grateful to the local communities that have welcomed me and the deep richness of everything this land provides me. I humbly welcome the shared responsibility to help all flourish in this place, now and into the future.
