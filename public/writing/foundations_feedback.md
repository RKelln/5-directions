# Foundations feedback

## Tech saavy, Ai enthusiast, software & hardware experience, OK internet:

- my first comment is that it has a lot of big words, which are perhaps industry jargon, like: indistinguishable, deterministic, repeatable.  If you are talking over it, and explaining those, that's probably ok, but if it's meant to be self-serve, you might need to use more and smaller words?
- there seem to be some all-black slides?  e.g. 11/7, 11/8, 11/9.  Maybe it's just not loading for me?
- 11/5 took like 15 seconds on my machine!
- slide 15 (/0), Recording: should be no OUTOUT, instead of no input
- Digital Ethics 16/0/2 - maybe add Who controls HOW it gets made? Or some variation thereof, basically, who is managing the process, and who gets input to that, or something along those lines, that like half of modern AI ethics.  What yes, who yes, but how really matters...
- hmmm, I feel like nature of a turing machine was not fully conveyed, if you could spend an extra minute that might be really helpful.  e.g. another sentence on "state" or "state machine" would be good.
- 12/2, I feel like it's important to show that the "spiderman neuron" ONLY activates for spiderman, i.e. show that for other things, it doesn't turn on.  Having six yes examples leaves a weird feeling that all neurons are yes neyrons... so maybe a table instead of the six things the way they are?
- slide 14 is super slow loading, the voice over pauses a lot...
- slide 17 is also super laggy
- for 22/2 rhe turing test, you failed to mention that the man pretends to be a woman!  Without that the whole thing doesn't make any sense
- My overall feeling is that way too much ground was covered way too quickly, but perhaps that was your idea for Foundations? I feel especially that the philosophical stuff (on intelligence at the end) was super fast, I'm up on all that stuff and you still lost me sometimes. I can't imagine how it would feel if you hadn't given it much thought yet.  
- The format was nice though, very slick to have auto-advancing slides with voice over, though in all honesty, given the lag problems, maybe it would be better to record the thing and offer a regular youtube video?
- In terms of going slower, where things could actually help people understand, I do feel like you should work a boolean math example, e.g. adding two (small, e.g. 4 bit) numbers, and how that might be done with and/or/not gates.  Obviously that would take ~5 minutes to explain, but I think it could be valuable for seeing how larger structures can be built from simpler ones, and then your bit about how computers use BILLIONS would land better.
- I understand why you have Intelligence as a subject in Foundations, since the field itself obviously started that way too, but I don't know that it was properly motivated from an outside perspective.  Why did the pioneers of computers think they were related to Intelligence at all? Maybe if you said something about how algorithms are a kind of "crystalized thinking" that could make for a more natural segway?


## tech savvy, not much AI experience, or software

- what is the purpose: educational or manifesto?
- fullscreen - double click to fullscreen
* space - bfore digital
- audio noticiable different - digital is strange
* code - mutations - audio popping
- click to pause?
* pauses after no audio slides in Chrome
- Hindu - Arabic numerals
* idiot or stupid - mental health - ableist language - foolish?


## audio expert, tech savvy, no ai or software 

- Slide one: Hau-den-no-sho-ne (pronunciation) -------> also maybe some personalization here?
- Love the interface!
* Recommend viewing in full-screen (otherwise the bottom is cropped out sometimes)
- Brain/nosebleed visual is wild!!
- Compute and Rule 110 starts to get confusing. Had to re-watch - what is a cellular atomida?
- Might want to put a low shelf filter and a bit more compression on the audio if you haven't already. Let me know if you want me to do a mastering. I have Audacity. Related: Mr. computer audio is a bit loud compared to the rest
* Goldilocks zone. This is education. I love it.
- Pegs. The music sounded really wild at the end there
* Katherine Hayles page - have the text pop up when you start reading it (easier to follow)


## other

* Added logo's to the special thanks page would be OCADU, InterAccess and the Canada Council for the Arts. 


## english as second language, no ai or software experience

- I've been using my phone (android) and everything worked perfectly. The size of the font and the font itself was clear and readable. The buttons did what they are supposed to do. 
- The length of the tutorial was good and I felt engaged at all time. 

- One thing that was hard for me to follow was when you read something from the screen and then in the middle of the text you spoke about it. 
I found myself struggling to finish reading the rest of the line and keep listening to you. I wasn't able to do both.
   - Brain Cantwell Smith
   - digital is useful and strange
  
- Towards the end of the presentation you choose more static images which made it easier for me to read the text on the screen and listen to you.

- Personally I find it very hard to read, follow a moving image on a screen and listen at the same time. I always lose some data (just like in the gorilla experiment in your video ;). People with attention disorder find it challenging.

- In conclusion, I won't change anything on this tutorial. It's excellent. It's high quality and professionally done. Beautiful visually. 

- You were right, it's for everyone, even people who have no understanding in computers. 


## large art/culture experience, limited tech / AI

* I think you could cut a bit of the time of software images as a series of spirals, that doesn't really explain itself.
- The images of the processing of "7" are a bit too long, as are the Patterns of recognizing: I'd find more useful to put your comment in writing on the screen, increasing the understanding of the concept, as also with the eye's sequence, that doesn't explain itself enough (in my opinion).
- I think you could take away the second screen with Frankenstein images when talking about the computer ballet.



# Other TODO:

* digital vs analog: digital - no values between, analog - infinite values between
