I acknowledge the land I live on is the traditional territory of many nations including the Mississaugas of the Credit, the Anishnabeg, the Chippewa, the Haudenosaunee and the Wendat peoples and is now home to many diverse First Nations, Inuit and MÃ©tis. I also acknowledge that Toronto is covered by Treaty 13 signed with the Mississaugas of the Credit, and the Williams Treaty signed with multiple Mississaugas and Chippewa bands.  

I am grateful to the local communities that have welcomed me and the deep richness of everything this land provides me. I humbly welcome the shared responsibility to help all flourish in this place, now and into the future.

# Five Directions Tutorials <!-- .element: class="r-fit-text" -->

<div class="backdrop lighten">

1. [**Foundations**](../foundations/) 
2. [**Past Present Future**](../past_present_future/) 
3. [**Neural Nets**](../neural_nets/) 
4. [**Data in Practice**](../data_in_practice/)
5. [**Machine Learning Art**](../ml_art/)

</div>

Notes:
Welcome to a five part tutorial series on machine learning and art. I'm really excited to share this with you, it's been a labour of love. I consider this to be an open source, continually improving work of art, rather than a definitive textbook. Your feedback and improvements are very welcome.

This series is intended for an audience of artists, scholars and makers to enhance your knowledge of machine learning and artificial intelligence systems, the theories behind them, their history and related philosophy, particularly in regard to art making.

You don't need any technical background, and I'll try to avoid overly complicated details, to focus on general and conceptual understanding of the material. By the end of the series I hope you will be able to think critically about these systems and collaborate better with data scientists, machine learning engineers and other technical specialists. To that end, we will focus on ethical data set collecting and curation and making art with deep learning techniques.

What is this?

Notes:
This tutorial is technically a web-based slideshow presentation using the Reveal.js framework, but I've tried to make it feel more like watching a video - except that it's a webpage and under your control. If you do nothing it will just autoplay. At least until we get to a part that is interactive in some way, then you'll need to click on something to continue, but I'll let you know when we get there.


<!-- .slide: id="controls" data-audio-src="../audio/intro/03.ogg" -->
Basic controls

<div class="small instructions">

* _spacebar_ to pause / resume
* _left_ & _up_ arrows to go back
* _right_ & _down_ arrows to go forward
* _esc_ to bring up a map to navigate
* _F_ to go to fullscreen ( _esc_ to exit )
* The red arrows in the bottom right also control movement
* The playback bar at the bottom controls the narration
* [**Text in red**](#) denotes clickable links
* _S_ to bring up speaker notes for accessible text
</div>

Press spacebar to continue <!-- .element: class="fragment glow" data-audio-advance="-1" -->

Notes:
There are slideshow-like controls that you can use to control the presentation. Spacebar will pause and resume. The left or up arrow will move you backward. The right or down arrows will move you forward. This is represented visually with the red arrows in the bottom right and clicking on them will react similarly.

The red bar at the bottom of the screen shows how far along you are in the presentation.

You can press the spacebar to continue when you're ready.
