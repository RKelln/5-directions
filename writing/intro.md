## Five Directions Tutorials

1. Foundations
2. Past, Present and Future
3. Neural Nets
4. Data in Practice
5. Machine Learning Art
   
Notes:
Welcome to a five part tutorial series on machine learning and art. I'm really excited to share this with you, it's been a labour of love.

This series is intended for an audience of artists, scholars and makers to enhance your knowledge of machine learning and artificial intelligence systems, the theories behind them, their history and related philosophy, particularly in regard to art making.

You don't need any technical background, and in general I'll try to avoid complicated details, preferring a more general and conceptual understanding of the material. By the end of the series I hope you will be able to think critically about these systems and collaborate better with data scientists and other technical specialists. To that end, we will focus on ethical data set collecting and curation and making art with machine learning techniques.

What is this?

Notes:
This tutorial is technically a web-based slideshow presentation, but I've tried to make it feel more like watching a video - except that it's a webpage and under your control. If you do nothing it will just autoplay. At least until we get to a part that is interactive in some way, then you'll need to click on something to continue, but I'll let you know when we get there.



Basic controls

* `spacebar` to advance
* Left/up arrows to go back
* Right/down arrows to go forward
* `esc` to bring up a map to navigate
* The red arrows in the bottom right also control movement
* `A` key stops the audio voiceover
  
Press spacebar to continue <!-- .element: class="fragment glow" data-audio-advance="-1" -->

Notes:
There are slideshow-like controls that you can use to control the presentation. Spacebar will always move you forward. The left or up arrow will move you backward. The right or down arrows will move you forward. This is represented visually with the red arrows in the bottom right and clicking on them will react similarly.

The red bar at the bottom of the screen shows how far along you are in the presentation.

Press spacebar to continue when you're ready.
