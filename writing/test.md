# Fundamentals

This is a test of markdown 

Note:
Before I can talk about why I make things, it's important to cover some basics.
Things that I learned from my own research, since my own education and culture often
left many stones unturned.

# Digital

Another markdown test

Notes:
We are told we live a digital world. And we gotten used to living there, 
and in many ways, forgotten how strange it really is.

Whatever our digital world is, it cannot escape reality. And reality, at least
at the level of electricity, is analog.

So at its lowest level a digital signal is still analog - a messy or noisy signal.

The blue line in the image represents this signal. You can see
it alternating between a 1 and a 0, the two possible digital values, but
still is affected by noise - the squiggly bits. But a digital signal is designed 
to overcome this noise, not to let it affect the signal.
