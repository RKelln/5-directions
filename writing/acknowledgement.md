I acknowledge the land I live on is the traditional territory of many nations
including the Mississaugas of the Credit, the Anishnabeg, the Chippewa, the
Haudenosaunee and the Wendat peoples and is now home to many diverse First
Nations, Inuit and MÃ©tis. I also acknowledge that Toronto is covered by Treaty 13 
signed with the Mississaugas of the Credit, and the Williams Treaty signed with 
multiple Mississaugas and Chippewa bands.

I humbly welcome the shared responsibility to help all flourish in this place,
now and into the future.
