                Before I can talk about why I make things, it's important to cover some basics.
                Things that I learned from my own research, since my own education and culture often
                left many stones unturned.

              <p>Digitalization is a tool to overcome noise</p>
              <aside class="notes">
                <p>We are told we live a digital world. And we gotten used to living there, 
                and in many ways, forgotten how strange it really is.</p>
                <p>Whatever our digital world is, it cannot escape reality. And reality, at least
                at the level of electricity, is analog.</p>
                <p>So at it's lowest level a digital signal is still analog - a messy or noisy signal.</p>
                <p>The blue line in the image represents this signal. You can see
                it alternating between a 1 and a 0, the two possible digital values, but
                still is affected by noise - the squiggly bits. But a digital signal is designed 
                to overcome this noise, not to let it affect the signal.</p>

              <p>The most reliably detectable of differences that 
                allow analog signalling machines to shrink to the tiniest of scales while best
                avoiding problems of <strong>noise</strong>.</p>

                <p>Digital technology is designed to create a perfect fantasy world where noise 
                doesn't exist. If you want to pevent noise from messing up your signal, it's 
                easiest to distinguish between only two noisy values. If you can do this perfectly, 
                every time, then you can have perfect lossless information storage and transfer.</p>
                <p>This lossless information then can be copied infinitely and stored without
                changing or degrading in any way.</p>

              <p>Digital technologies are useful and strange:</p>
              <ol>
                <li class="fragment fade-right"><strong>Everything is copied.</strong>
                  Movement is done by copying and then deleting.
                  <span class="detail">(Or more often copying and then marking the original as available to be 
                  overwritten by something else - because deleting by writing zeros is unnecessarily wasteful.)</span></li>
                <li class="fragment fade-right"><strong>Copies are perfect</strong> and 
                  indistinguishable from the original. <span class="detail">Making the very concept of original 
                  and copy very suspect, especially if that is the only way digital things 
                  can move.</span></li>
                <li class="fragment fade-right"><strong>Software is deterministic</strong>
                  and thus repeatable by default, true randomness is difficult.</li>
